# Rust Anagram Checker

A minimalist Rust CLI tool to check if two words are anagrams.

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
cargo run word1 word2
```
Example:
```bash
cargo run listen silent
# "listen" and "silent" are anagrams!
```

## 📚 How it works
- Takes two words as arguments.
- Compares their letters after sorting.
- Prints whether they are anagrams.

## 🌟 Why this project?
Wanted a quick way to practice Rust string handling and CLI use.  
Perfect for exercising clean logic, minimal design & Rust basics.

## 💡 Fun fact
True code elegance is when even the smallest utility has clarity, balance, and purpose.  
An anagram: simple letters, infinite combinations—like code, it’s all about the right arrangement.

If you spot anything that could be written in a more idiomatic or elegant Rust style, I’m always curious to understand why.
